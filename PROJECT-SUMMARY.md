## 🎨 Why These Design Decisions Work

### Simple Pro Style
- **Professional credibility:** Not too casual, builds trust
- **Modern without being trendy:** Won't look dated in 2 years
- **Conversion-focused:** Clear CTAs, strong hierarchy
- **SaaS aesthetic:** Matches expectations for digital health products

### Indigo + Cyan Gradient
- **Medical yet approachable:** Professional but not clinical
- **Energy and hope:** Cyan = refreshing, Indigo = trustworthy
- **Stands out:** Most health sites use green/blue, this differentiates
- **Modern:** Gradients are contemporary without being gimmicky

### Modern Slim Battery Logo
- **Perfect metaphor:** Everyone with CFS feels "depleted"
- **Instantly recognizable:** Clear at any size
- **Unique:** Better than generic health symbols
- **Emotional connection:** "My battery is empty" → relatable
- **Modern proportions:** Sleek like iPhone battery indicator

### Medical Line Icons
- **Builds credibility:** Looks research-backed
- **Clear communication:** Immediately recognizable
- **Timeless:** Won't feel dated
- **Professional authority:** Says "we know what we're doing"
- **Balance:** Battery = emotional, icons = scientific

### Radiant-Style Animations
- **Polished feel:** Smooth animations = professional quality
- **Not overwhelming:** Can still read while scrolling
- **Guides attention:** Directs eye to important elements
- **Modern standard:** Users expect this level of polish
- **Trustworthy:** Janky animations = amateur, smooth = pro

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Development Starts
1. **Domain:** What domain will this be on?
2. **Email Service:** Which platform for newsletter? (ConvertKit, Mailchimp, etc.)
3. **Video:** What's the real YouTube video ID?
4. **Analytics:** Google Analytics or Plausible?
5. **Content:** How much blog content is ready?

### During Development
- Stick to the design system (don't invent new colors/spacing)
- Use provided SVG code exactly (already optimized)
- Follow component structure (makes future updates easier)
- Test mobile at each phase (don't wait until the end)
- Keep accessibility in mind (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)

### Quality Bars
- **Lighthouse Performance:** 90+ (optimize images, lazy load)
- **Lighthouse Accessibility:** 95+ (proper contrast, alt text)
- **Mobile Responsive:** All breakpoints work perfectly
- **Cross-Browser:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- **Animation FPS:** Smooth 60fps (use transform/opacity only)
